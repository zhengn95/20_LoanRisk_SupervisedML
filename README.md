# LoanRisk_SupervisedML
In this repository, we use various techniques of Supervised Machine Learning to evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity is used from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. See the jupyter notebook `credit_risk_classification.ipynb` for the code.
