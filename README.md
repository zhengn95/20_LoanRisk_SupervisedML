# Evaluating Loan Risk using Supervised Machine Learning  
In this repository, various techniques of Supervised Machine Learning were used to evaluate a model based on loan risk.  

### Introduction: Supervised Machine Learning  
### Overview of Analysis 
**Purpose** A dataset of historical lending activity was used from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. See the jupyter notebook `credit_risk_classification.ipynb` for the code.  
**Targets & Features**?? Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).

**Methods & Process**
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.  
Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).  
Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

### Results  
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.
* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

### Summary  
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )  
  
If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
